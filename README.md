# Covid19
Lots of people are doing this. I hope I am not adding to the noise. I am not an epidemiologist, just somebody interested in data around this pandemic.

## General Overview
I'm particularly interested in testing, as a big issue I believe was lack of testing, so people had to make decisions on very incomplete data. I'm not going to pretend I can predict what will happen next. 

## Sources
The COVID Tracking Project (covidtracking.com) - good data including testing data and an API, even

US Census (census.gov) - population data, demographics, etc
